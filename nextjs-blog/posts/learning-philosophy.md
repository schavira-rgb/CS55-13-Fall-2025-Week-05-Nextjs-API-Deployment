# Going Deeper Than Just Code

I believe in understanding technology at a fundamental level, not just writing code that works, but understanding why it works and how it can be improved or secured.

## My Learning Approach

1. **Start with the basics**: Understand networking, systems, and protocols
2. **Build practical skills**: Hands-on experience with real tools and technologies  
3. **Think like an attacker**: Understanding vulnerabilities helps build better defenses
4. **Stay curious**: Technology evolves rapidly, continuous learning is essential

## Current Coursework Integration

My current classes work together perfectly:

- **CS82.2C (Networking, Security,& Automation)**: Understanding infrastructure and security protocols
- **CS180.3 (Virtualization/Cloud)**: Understanding infrastructure
- **CS55.13 (Server-Side Development)**: Building secure web applications
- **ETHS20 (Ethnic Studies)**: Understanding diverse perspectives in technology

## The Bigger Picture

Technology isn't just about solving problems, it's about understanding the impact our solutions have on people and society. This holistic approach drives my career direction in cybersecurity.
