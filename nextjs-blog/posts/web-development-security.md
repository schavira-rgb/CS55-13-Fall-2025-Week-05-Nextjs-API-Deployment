# Why Security Matters in Web Development

After completing HTML and CSS coursework, I'm now diving into server-side technologies. Understanding both sides of web development is crucial for identifying and preventing security vulnerabilities.

## Key Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Never trust user input
- **Authentication**: Proper user verification systems
- **Data Protection**: Securing sensitive information
- **Server Configuration**: Hardening production environments

## Learning Through Next.js

Learning Next.js has shown me how modern frameworks handle many security concerns automatically, but developers still need to understand the underlying principles.

### Server-Side Rendering Benefits

- Reduced client-side exposure
- Better control over data flow
- Enhanced SEO and performance

Understanding these concepts from a security perspective helps build more robust applications.
